It's a slow beginning but I'm hoping to build it into a bigger story with multiple chapters, so I had to do a bit of a set-up first. Do suggets changes or improvment.

"An exciting opertunity has just come up." Sgt. Jeffords adressed the squad gathered in the briefing room.

"A interagency manhunt needs people to man a survailance of a dropspot. Is anyone interrested?"

Amy's hand had shot up the second Interagency had been uttered. Any oppertunity to add to her already impressiv resume would be welcomed and she had wanted to improve her stakeout skills for some time.

"Amy you know how highly the Captain and Myself think of you and your ability as a detective. But this might be a job more suited for a male detective." Sgt Jeffords explained.

"The hell's that supposed to mean?" Rosa spoke from the back.

"Amy can do the job of everyone here twice over"

Never had Amy seen a person walk into a new job and get away with the things Rosa did. At this moment she had her legs on the desk she was sitting at. Amy had not really gotten the chance to talk to this new hire, as Rosa had only been at the 99 for a few weeks and didn't seem like the kind of person who enjoyed small talk.

Still, Amy had suddently gotten a lot of new respect for her colleage. Women cops and especially detective were few and far between. It was nice to know someone had her back.

"Yeah, I can do as good a job as anyone here" Amy found herself spured on by Rosa and decided to openly question her superiors decision. Something that she would have never considered before.

"Yeah!" Charles jumped to the oppertunity the cheer something.

"It's not a matter of your ability" Jeffords franticly tried to explain himself as to not appear to believe his female detectives weren't just as capable as the males of the 99th disctrict.

"Jeffords, Amy and I are going to do this and we are going to crush it" Rosa's intensity made it perfectly clear there wasn't any reason to argue but Terry wanted to at least explain his position.

"Alright it's yours. But the survailance sit is upstate, pretty deep inside a national park -without facilities. I'll give you a more detailed brief. Everyone else is dismissed" Jeffords got grabbed a few papers from his stack and went to grab a whiteboard while the briefing room emptied.

Amy had suddently become unsure that she had made the right decision. It would be a fantastic oppertunity and she wanted to show everyone that Rosa had been right - she could do everything the other detectives and officers could. Excempt what might come in real handy on a stake-out in a big forrest. Pee outside just as easy as inside.

"Good luck, Santiago" Peralta teased on his way out of the room followed up by Charles's

"Woooo, girl power!"

"What was that about?" Rosa put a hand on Amy's shoulder.

"Oh that's just Charles. He loves to cheer." Amy said turning to her new partner.

"I've noticed. But what did Jake mean?"

"Oh nothing he's just a bit of an jokester"

Rosa's grumble didn't sound to convinced but Jeffords interrupted any chance she had to dig into what ever Amy was hiding.

"Before we begin, do you understand why I say what I say? I don't want any of you to believe in anyway I don't think as highly of you two, as I do of anyone else here. Higher usually." Jeffords had taken a seat across the table from Amy.

"I know Terry" Amy assured him. She didn't want there to be any bad feelings between them as he was the best sergant she had been assigned to in her time with the NYPD.

"But that doesn't mean you should assume not having facilities is anymore of an obsticle for us than the guys here" Rosa needed to make sure she hadn't once again been dropped somewhere to be a pretty face in the office. That wasn't why she became a detective.

"And that's on me. To be honest, I wanted to pick you two specefically for this but I didn't want to throw you into a forrest alone if you weren't comfortable with it." Jeffords stod and walked over to the whiteboard.

"Shall we get started?"

###

Besides the location it was a very normal stake-out. Local police had caught a mule who gave up a drop spot used by a gang of drugtrafficers. Rosa and Amy had to man a small camp setup by parkrangers overlooking the shelters and report any coming and goings.

Next team would relieve them after 2 days. They would drive up friday morning, relieve the previous team at 2pm and get relieved sunday at 2pm.

###

Friday morning

Amy went through the notes about the mission again while she drank her coffee. She never really drank coffee in the morning but she had a feeling she was going to need it today. Because she normally woke early it had only been 30 minutes less sleep she had gotten but they defiently made a difference.

She glanced over to the packed bags by her door. It wasn't long until she had to head out the door to the precinct to meet up with Rosa and hit the road. She couldn't let go of the feeling that she had forgotten to pack something, but she had spent most of thursday packing and planning what to pack and then repacking. She had a couple diapers left from tests in the academy but she coudn't possibly bring them. It's not like she could use them without Rosa's knowledge. They had been in and out of her bag multiple times, ending up out of them. She dismissed the concern, putting it down to nerves about the mission and working close to a new partner.

If only she could coordinate with Rosa, but she didn't have her phone number. Or knew where she lived, or anything about her really. Amy had tried to get Rosa's number at the precinct during the week but she never seemed to have any luck on that front. Amy made a mental note to get it on their way to the park.

Amy was ripped out of her thoughts as there was a knock at her door. Opening her door she was surprised to see Rosa at the other side.

"Sup?" Rosa's sunglasses met Amy's eyes in the low morning sun.

"Rosa? What are you doing here so early?"

"Ready?" Rosa held up a keyring with the department insigna, meaning she already had been to the presinct to check out a car.

"Wanted to get a headstart, get to the camp early to get some info from the guys before us."

"How did you know I was going to even be dressed?" Amy felt out of her element suddently having her morning routine obrubtly distrurbed.

"Deal was to meet at the prescinct in 45 minutes. Everytime Peralta is late you remark how you get up earlier to miss morning traffic. Figured you were planning to leave in about 10 minutes time."

"Oh. 5 minutes actually. I just need to finish my coffee and run to the bathroom and we can hit the road." Amy felt read like a book, but at least she knew Rosa was talented.

"Perfect. I prefer to only stop for gas. I'll throw your bags into the car" Rosa said stepping into the apartment.

Amy felt that the "prefer" was mostly a coutisy because Rosa hadn't been at the department for longer.

Amy finish the last of her coffee and went to the bathroom, making sure to enjoy to running water and actual toilet a bit more than normal.

As she washed her hands a stray though found a home and she opened the cabnet under the sink and felt her heart sink as she noticed the diapers weren't sitting in the back waiting the next written exam. She must have ended up putting them in one of the bags. She hadn't forgotten to pack something, she had forgotten to unpack something!

###

The car ride had been quite so far. They had been driving for about an hour or so and mostly the only sounds had been the gps and Amy's playlist on the car stereo. Amy had actually enjoyed the silence as she was used to sitting in silence listening to music on her trainride to and from work. But today wasn't at chill as her normal commute, as Amy had also tried to gauge Rosa's thoughts from her face. Both about her playlist and whether or not it "Blew ass" as Rosa had asked before handing Amy the AUX, but also whether had any reservations about the mission.

"I need to ask you something." Rosa broke the silence.

"Shoot" Amy were surprised she wasn't going to be the one to speak first. She felt more in control again after this morning.

"What was Jake refering to?"

"Oh" As suddently as she had gain control as suddently she had lost it again.

"It's nothing, just a joke"

"Hey Amy, we're partners on this, we need to trust eachother."

Amy really didn't particularly wanted to relive the moment but Amy could she the idea of sharing stories on the way to the National park.

"I missed out on a pursuit because I had to pee. We had been sitting outside a house for hours and I just had to pee. So I stepped out of the car to find a restroom. Perp showed up 2 minutes later. Just bad luck!" Amy tried to laugh it off but she couldn't help but feel her bladder sometimes worked against her.

"HA!" Rosa's outburst almost starteled Amy.

"Don't sweat it Amy. Don't get me wrong but how much good were you going to do if you had stayed?"

Amy had to agree with Rosa. She wasn't going to be any help in a chase if she was bursting.

"Besides Jake once lost a guy because he hadn't tied his shoes right. Came undone while he was running and next thing he saw was the ground." Amy couldn't recall seeing Rosa laugh before.

The next hour or so went by quickly as the detectives shared stories of solved cases, crazy crimes and bad superiors. Rosa had gotten a couple of drinks and snacks packed that they had started dipping into as the miles flew by.

###

"If you see any gas stations coming up, let me know. We need to fill it soon and we should probably switch drivers."

Rosa's word were perfectly timed as the last of the coffee and the drinks in the car were catching up to Amy.

"I'll be on the lookout. I have to run to the bathroom as well" Amy said hoping Rosa wasn't going to think it was to soon to have to pee again.

"Yeah why not" Rosa nodded, much to Amy's delight and surprise.

A Gas station bathroom was probably still better than what was to come the next couple of days, and if Amy could get through the drives, to and from the camp, without forcing Rosa to stop more than necesarry she was it would help their friendship.

"7 miles" Amy said noticing a sign at the side of the highway.

"DAMMIT" Rosa exclaimed as the traffic in front of them suddently slowed down to a crawl.

"Ough! Well I guess it's going to be a slow 7 miles." Amy's words were just as much an attempt to ease her self as Rosa.

"Yup"

The silence once again fell over the car. Nothing could accelerate Amy's need than knowing a bathroom was close but still out of reach, but she was going to make it to that gas station.

If she could. It felt like the cars around them wasn't even moving anymore. She was wondering if there was anyway she could help herself hold on without being to obvius. She wanted to put a hand in her crotch but settled on just crossing her legs tight. Amy had to find someway to focus her mind on something other than her bladder.

"So, what have you packed by the way?" She enquired hoping some conversation would distract her.

"Usual stuff for being outdoors, knife, lantern, rope, extra socks" Rosa sighed adjusting in her seat.

"Oh I should have gotten a lantern" Amy tried to keep her mind on the conversation.

"One's enough. That it?"

Amy looked outside and saw a very welcome sight as the gas station came into view around a bend in the road. Unfortunatly it was still a mile or two down the road. She kept having to keep herself from grabbing her crotch.

"Yes it has to be!" Amy said excited.

"Would you mind if I just run to the bathroom when we get there? I'm getting kind of desperat?" Amy admitted shifting in her seat.

Rosa looked at Amy and back to the gas station. Amy noticed her free leg bouncing up and down.

"I was thinking we park and go to the bathroom before we fill up" Rosa said.

"If they have any left" Amy noticed how many cars were turning of the highway at the station.

"Frees up the highway, we can take the next one." Rosa was starting to fidget more and more.

"Honestly Rosa, we have no idea when that is! I really have to pee!" Amy said finally giving into putting her hands between her legs.

Rosa had definetly noticed Amy's hand because a moment later she had a hand between hers as well.

"But can you wait for god knows how many other women in line?"

Rosa's voice cracked just enough for Amy to notice. She had been so preocupied with how badly she needed to pee she hadn't noticed Rosa was pretty desperate as well. A hunch hit her and to satisfy her curiosity she tried to catch a glimpse of the fuel gage, but she couldn't get an angle.

"Didn't we have to get fuel as well? We need to stop at a gasstation"

Amy didn't really know what answer she hoped for. If they really needed gas she could hopefully get Rosa to stop here but if it was just a excuse so Rosa could go pee, she might be more desperate than Amy! If that was possible.

"The gas can wait. But I don't think we can" Rosa finally saw an opening for the gas station and raced up the offramp.

"Where can we park?" she hissed to noone in particular.

"There!" Amy exclaimed as she noticed a car had just backed out of a spot and Rosa threw the car into the space.

Amy really didn't want to move her hands from their place between her thighs but she had to open the door and she was out of the car before Rosa had killed the engine. She quickly found the building housing the bathrooms and Amy almost squeled in delight when she couldn't see any line outside the door with women painted on.

"Come on!" She said to Rosa and walked as fast as she could in the direction of the bathroom. She wanted to run. She wanted to run so badly but she wanted more to hang onto a shred of dignity and besides moving her legs quicker would only result in her losing it. She just had to hold on a few moments more but to hell with dignity, she once again burried a hand in her crotch and pushed open the door with the other hand.

"How long is this going to be?!"

The woman at the front of the line asked desperatly as she knocked on one of the closed stall doors. 8 women in line. All from the traffic jam. All with hands between their legs or doing the potty dance. The realisation stunned Amy. There was no way she was going to make it! How could this happen! She couldn't start this mission of by peeing her pants like a child!

Amy was ripped back to reality as she felt a couple drops escape her. She had to act now! And no way she was going to cut in line. She had to come up with something else. She turned to Rosa to ask for help only to find no-one behind her.

###

Rosa couldn't believe how desperat she had become. It had been a long time since she had needed to pee so bad! All because she didn't pee at Amy's. So much pride and look where that got her, about to pee herself in a gas station parking lot after holding herself in front of Amy like some todler.

Still could be worse. Amy had decided against listening to her about the line in the bathrooms and Rosa wasn't going to make that mistake. She had noticed a grouping of bushes and trees not to far from the car and that was a much better solution. Even if it was technically illegal.

As Amy waddled to the bathroom, she potty danced on the spot and locked the car. When the lock clicked she quickly glansed around. Luckily there wasn't a person in sight and she could undo her belt buckle, releasing much of the pressure from her bladder. The black leather pants she had worn had one major fault. The belt buckle ended up directly on her bladder and it would usually be one of the first things she did when she had to pee, but in the car there simply hadn't been a way to do it. This time however she was so desperate that even than wasn't enough that she didn't feel the need to keep one hand in her crotch for extra support.

The bushes weren't far away but it felt long as Rosa hurried out of sight. As she reached the bushes she knew it was now or never. A couple of drops had already escaped and the first small opening had to be privat enough as Rosa jump into her green hiding spot and pulled her pants and panties down. She had almost forgotten how good it felt to pee when one had become so desperate, and had to strain to keep from sighing in relief. After all she still had to be on the lookout to make sure she wasn't spottet. From her hiding spot she spottet Amy exiting the restrooms way quicker than she expected. Maybe she'd been wrong about the lengh of the line.

###

There was only one option left for Amy. She had at most a couple of minutes before her bladder completly gave out and she would spent the rest of the day soaked. She really didn't want to use this option but desperat times call for desperat means.

She turned back out the door and looked around. A few meters down the building she saw her saving grace. The door with men written along. Leaks be damned now she had to run.

As her free hand reach the handle she pressed the other one in to her crotch harder as she could feel dampness starting to appear. Even still she had to take a deep breath before she opened the door.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm sorry" She repeated as she ran by 2 very confused men at the urinal trying to cover her eyes and still find an open stall. She kicked open the stall door and even before she had completly pulled down her pants completly the floodgate opened. She threw herself on the toilet and couldn't help but sigh deeply as her bladder emptied.

The redness on her checks was however spreading very quickly. Firstly Rosa had witnessed her way more desperat than she was comfortable with, secondly she had had to run through a occupied mensroom on the verge of peeing herself and thirdly she hadden't gotten a hold of her panties when she removed her pants. As it were she was now wearing completly soaked through panties and her pants had a fairly sizeble wet patch right between the legs.

Amy wanted the earth to open up and swallow her right then and there. And when what was clearly a mans hand reached in and closed the still open stall door, she was ready to dig the hole herself.

*002*2022-04-26 06:59

As Amy's flood turned to a stream and then a trickle, she gathered her thoughts and dried herself off. Firstly she had to figure out what to do about her soaked panties. The stall didn't have a trashcan and in her panic she hadn't grabbed her bag or anything from the car. She would either have to wear them under her pants therefore risk them soaking through the fabric of her pants and spend the rest of the day in soaked underwear, leave them in some mens room at a highway gas station or walk out of the stall and all the way to the car with holding it in her hand.

Or perhaps there was another option. Amy undid her shoelaces and kicked of her shoes so she could stand bare feet on top of them. No way she would touch that floor if she could help it. Luckily a lot of physical training made her balance so good she could alternate between standing on one leg and remove her pants and then afterward remove her panties.

She had one last look at what had been one of her favorite pairs of underwear and then threw them into the toilet bowl, hoping and praying to everything that when she flushed, the evidence would disappear. While she'd been completing her acrobatics, Amy had heard the faucets turn on and door open twice, maybe her luck had turned just enough that she wouldn't have to face anyone on the other side of the stall. With her shoes back on Amy steeled herself and flushed the toilet and watched everything dissapear with a wirl.

"Thanks bad guys" Amy whispered before quickly heading out of the stall.

###

Rosa inspected what she could see of the pink underwear and found to her delight there barely was a wet spot. She prided herself on her ability to control her body and was pleased it had mostly held.

She pulled her pants and panties back up and looked around to see if anyone would notice her exiting her hiding place. The only person in the area was a girl who Rosa suspected had been stuck in the same traffic jam as Amy and herself. The girl had a hand between her legs and was frantically looking around while she stepped from one leg to the other.

"Psst!" Rosa said and stepped out from her hiding spot.

The girl froze and turned her head to Rosa.

"In here" Rosa directed the girl.

"Oh my god thank you so much" the girl exclaimed as she stepped past Rosa.

Rosa closed her belt buckle and started to walk back towards the car when the familiar hiss started behind her.

###

When Amy returned to the car, Rosa was leaning against the boot waiting for her.

"Where did you go?" Amy enquired as she was sure Rosa couldn't still be holding on.

"Bushes" Rosa nodded in the direction some bushes and trees were a girl came into view.

"Told you bathrooms were a bad idea"

"But public urination is a crime!" Amy knew most people wouldn't care at all but it was the principle of it that Amy had trouble with.

"Isn't it also technically against the law to use a differently gendered bathroom?"

Rosa had a point but Amy didn't really want to admit it. She also had to contend with the fact Rosa had seen her rush into the mensroom.

"Should we get going?" Amy asked to change the subject.

"I'm hungry, let's grab some food and fill up first" Rosa said and handed Amy the car keys.

"And we're still swapping right?"

Amy grabbed the keys and they headed off to get some early lunch.

###

The small food court of the gas station was surprisingly empty. Amy had to assume most of the people who had left the highway had done so to use the bathroom and not much else. The detectives quickly found what they wanted and sat down in a booth.

"So do you have any thoughts on the mission?" Amy said between bites.

"Catch the bad guys. Kick ass."

"I was thinking we probably should switch between who stays awake during the night, do you want the first or second night?"

"Isn't the park closed during the night?" Rosa enquired. "Do you think our guy would risk being suspicious by sneaking in at night when he could walk right in during the day?"

"True but shouldn't we account for all possiblities"

"We'll make those decisions when we get to the camp and can see everything for us self"

"Come on Rosa, we might as well plan a bit while we eat" Amy pleaded. Rosa though for a second before nodding.

"I'll take second night" Rosa put down her fork and looked at Amy.

"Isn't it still considered public urination in a national park?"

"What?" Amy was sure she had misheard Rosa.

"Just accounting for all possiblities - how are you going to pee outside at the camp?"

"You're right. We'll deal with somethings when we get there" Amy said trying - and failing - not to blush a bit.

"Ha!" Rosa exclaimed and shook her head.

###

They finished up their lunch and bought a few snacks for the rest of the drive before leaving the food court. As they walked past the door signed Women, Rosa slowed her step.

"Should we?"

Amy looked at her then at the door.

"Yeah probably"

She opened the door and found an empty bathroom on the other side.

"Typical" Amy sighed

"Probably means the traffic's cleared up at least" Rosa concluded as they both noticed they big yellow sign left on the floor.

Wet floor

The detectives looked at each other and then they burst out laughing. They regained composure and burst out laugh a couple of times before they finally were able to do what they came to do.

As Amy pulled down her pants she was reminded how close she had been to become the reason for another yellow sign. Between the lunch and laughing fit she had completly forgotten the fate of her panties. Luckily Rosa was in another stall and were none the wiser.

###

Back on the road the silence was back but it was much less awkward than earlier that morning. Amy had gone through at lot of miles and they were soon going to be at the ranger station they were supposed to check in at and leave their car before getting a lift to the campsite. Amy however was much more focused on her crotch as every movement of her legs had made the seams in her jeans saw into her skin without the layer of fabric from her panties. She had apparently been fidgeting to find a more comfortable way to sit as Rosa broke the silence.

"Hey Amy, do you need to pee?"

"What?" Amy hadn't really been paying attention.

"You're fidgeting"

"Oh sorry" Amy raced to make up some excuse.

"I think I'm just ready to get out of the car I guess"

"Me to" Rosa nodded.

"I'm used to feeling the air when driving"

"Huh?"

"I ride motorcycles"

"Ohh, yeah I couldn't do that. I'd be way to scared to crash and get injured" Amy welcomed the distraction.

"It's just a matter of confidence - bike knows if you're hesitating."

Amy nodded unsure about how much a bike could actually tell about your mental state.

"Like this assignment." Rosa turned to Amy looking even more serious than normal.

"Would you have fought for this without me there? You're better than anyone else in the department Amy. But you're second guessing yourself and your abilities."

Amy was stunned. She desperately wanted to tell Rosa how wrong she was and that she would have gotten this assignment by herself, but she knew it wasn't the true. She knew she was a great detective and she was nailing every report and had one of the highest solve-rate in the department. Still she be more assertive and confident in herself.

"I probably wouldn't have" Amy sighed.

"but not because I'm not as good a detective."

Rosa lifted an eyebrow but stayed quiet inviting Amy to continue.

"I've never actually learn to..." Amy struggled to find the words.

"Pee. Outside. You know?"

There was a moment of silence as Amy looked over to Rosa trying to gauge her reaction.

"Ha! We are going to have an interesting weekend!" Rosa laughed, and after a couple moments Amy started to laugh as well.

*003*2022-05-04 15:04

Amy pulled the car up to the Ranger station and the detectives stepped out into the fresh air of the forrest.

"I'll grab our bags if you head inside and check us in" Amy said across the roof of the car.

"Sure" Rosa said and walked up the wooden stairs and headed inside.

Amy opened the boot of the car and started unloading bags.

As soon as Rosa was out of view she opened her bag, and looked at the diapers staring back at her. She pushed them out of the way and digged around for a pair of panties. When she found a couple she threw them in her backpack and closed her bag up again.

###

In the cabin Rosa found a few desks, a small kitchen in a corner of the room next to a table where the rangers ate and a small tv on a shelf overlooking the office/breakroom.

"Can I help you?" a shrill voice met her from the female ranger sitting at a computer.

"Detectives Diaz and Santiago. We are the next shift on the stake-out." Rosa stepped over to the desk and showed her badge to the ranger.

"Oh the big city girl coming up here to do our job?" The ranger found a handheld radio in a drawer.

"I'll get you a ride to the camp."

Rosa was taken aback by the hostililty in her voice and didn't have a chance to speak before the ranger was already busy with the radio.

Instead she walked over to the table and leaned against it until Amy came through the door with some of their bags slung over her shoulders and the rest in her hands. Rosa put out her arms to help Amy off with a couple of the bags in her hands.

"Thank you" She stammered out from underneath the mountain of bags. They placed the bags in a pile by the table and Amy massaged her shoulder.

"Guess it was a bit optimistic" Amy laughed

"A bit" Rosa said looking at all the bags. She then nodded towards the ranger behind the computer "Don't think we're really welcome here."

"What's up?"

"She believes we're a couple of big city detectives here to show them how it's done." Rosa rolled her eyes.

"I'll try talking to her" Amy said and walked over to the desk.

"Hey I just wanted to say hello. We're really happy to be here"

"Doubt you'll feel like that after a couple days of being outside"

"I'm sure we'll be just fine. Just happy to help." Amy continued in a chipper tone.

"And I'm happy to get you out into the forrest. I'm already on the radio to get someone to pick you up so if you'd leave me to it."

"Thank you. And I promise you we aren't here to show you anything. We just want to lent a helping hand." Amy tried.

"Good luck. I doubt you two city girls realise what you're going to be in for camping out in the woods." The ranger snarked and keyed up the radio.

Rosa put a hand on Amy's shoulder and motioned for them to take a seat at the table. They weren't here to make friends or change the mind of other departments personal. They place their bags by the table and took a seat while the ranger was busy with the radio.

"They'll come get you in 15 minutes" The ranger said and immediatly returned to her computer to make sure Amy and Rosa knew she wasn't inviting them to chat.

"I'll call the sergant and tell him we're here. Not sure how the service is further into the forrest." Amy said and stepped out of the ranger station.

Rosa decided she might as well go to the bathroom one last time before they get to the camp and walked over to the female ranger.

"You got a bathroom here?"

"Oh honey if you need that you're even more out of your depth than I though." The ranger said without looking up from her computer.

"I can handle myself out there, but why the hell not use it when we're waiting 15 minutes."

"Ain't happening princess."

Rosa took a deep breath. She wanted to cuss out the ranger and make her understand that they were on the same side. But She knew it wasn't going to help anything. She might as well sit back down and wait until their ride got there.

Amy came back in not long after.

Alright we're all set, how long til they get here?"

"Around 10 or so minutes." Rosa said when the ranger's stilness made it clear she was going to ignore them until they left.

"Great. I'll just use the bathroom quickly" Amy said and grabbed her backpack.

"Nuh-uh" The ranger shook her head from the desk.

Amy looked to Rosa quizzically. Rosa rolled her eyes and shrugged. Amy sat back down and the 3 women waited in silence until they heard the rumble of a car engine.

"Guess that's them" Amy said and got up.

"Yeah must be"

Rosa grabbed her bags and they stepped outside where a pickup truck with the park logo painted on the side pulled up. The window rolled down and a ranger greeted them with a smile.

"You two the detectives from brooklyn?" The man behind the wheel asked.

"Yes are you our ride?" Amy asked hoping he was just going into the station and were more lenient with bathroom access. She didn't have to pee to bad but she had hoped to use the privacy to put some panties back on without Rosa knowing.

"Yes Ma'm" The ranger said and got out, extending a hand to Amy and then Rosa.

"Ranger Christianson at your service"

The detectives shook his hand and loaded their bags and then themselfs into the pickup truck. Rosa had taken the back seat while Amy rode up front. She didn't have to pee too bad yet but she was unsure how far they had to drive and the privacy of the backseat allowed her to cross her legs if necesarry.

Soon they were on their way deeper into the forrest.

"Hope Rose didn't give you to much trouble?" Ranger Christianson asked

"Not to bad" Amy assured

"I apologize for her. She have some deepseated grudge against anyone from cities bigger than a couple thousand people. Luckily you won't have to deal with her any more during your stay. It will most likely be me or one of my colleages who patrol in the forrest."

"Oh we were under the impression that we would be all alone?" Amy perked up.

"Mostly yes but we'll do a check in the morning and in the evning - bring you supplies and anything else you might need. you can just radio in a couple hours before and we'll do our best"

"Thank you! It's nice to know we have some backup who knows the woods more than we do." Amy smiled at the ranger and Rosa couldn't help but wonder if she found him cute. Or maybe she was imagining it, trying to find a distraction. The bumpy dirt roads hadn't been kind to her bladder and she already had to cross her legs.

"How far is the camp?" Rosa asked from the back.

"About 20 minutes. You good back there?"

"Yeah just wondering" Rosa turned her attention to the beauty of the forrest they were driving through.

###

Sitting in the passenger seat was much better for Amy, not needing to use any pedals had kept her jeans from sawing into her crotch but as the pain subsided she had needed to pee more and more. Fairly quickly into the ride it had already become quite concerning so she had probaly needed to pee for some time but haven't felt it

Ranger christianson had been pointing out interresting sites and telling stories about the forrest as he drove and Amy dared to cross her legs hoping he'd be to distracted to notice and adjusted her seatbelt away from her bladder.

"We were told there weren't any facilities by the camp, do you know if there is any we could walk to?" Amy interrupted the ranger who had been talking about the difference between two trees they had passed but Amy hadn't been listening.

"Oh no unfortunetly there aren't any at the camp, there are a first aid station a bit more than a mile from the camp but if you get injured, just key up the radio and we'll be there" The ranger assured.

"I was thinking more - " Amy hesitated a bit trying to find the words but Rosa interrupted.

"She was wondering if there were any toilets close by?"

Amy looked back and saw Rosa quickly remove a hand from her crotch but she kept her legs crossed tightly. She obviously also had to pee quite bad.

"Oh ehm" The ranger suddently seemed uncomforable.

"Unfortunatly not. We had tried to communicate that who ever took this assignment had to be comfortable with using nature, but I apologise if that wasn't clear."

"No no we have no problem with that." Amy said to assure herself as much as the ranger.

"We just hoped we might be lucky"

"No unfortunatly, but the camp is quite isolated so you'll have more than enough privacy."

This wasn't much encouragment for Amy has she still had to figure out how to pee outside, and she was getting quite desperate. She glansed back to Rosa and cursed herself for taking the front seat. Rosa had her hand deeply burried in her crotch and Amy really wanted to mirror her but there was simply no way to do so discreetly.

###

Rosa was fidgeting as much as she possibly could without the ranger noticing. She didn't really care about Amy, she had already seen her need to pee once today and she had definetly noticed her hand earlier. But more bumps had done their work and now she had to hold herself with both hands and bounce her legs up and down, it was only a matter of time before she had to say he needed to stop.

"Here we are"

The words were angelic to Rosa and as the truck rolled to a stop she undid her seatbelt and jumped out. Standing up eased a bit of her pressure but she still stood cross legged.

"Hello" A roughlooking man waved to them from a small clearing with 2 tents and a fireplace. The ranger stepped out of the truck and waved back.

"Alright lets get you two unloaded and the boys back to civilation" He said and started to unload bags from the truck.

"I'll be right back" Rosa said and turned towards the forrest. She was so incredibly close to the bushes that would grant her relief when a man called out to her.

"Hey just want to give you a status while my partner loads up our stuff." Another fairly rough-looking man came over to her and extended a hand.

"Deputy Clayton and my partner is deputy Hanstead. Local sheriffs"

Rosa looked to the forrest and crossed her legs tighter before grabbing his hand and shaking it.

"Detectives Diaz and Santiago, NYPD."

"It's been quite down there while we've been here. They might have switched to a different drop-spot." Deputy Clayton explained while he pointed out the drop spot.

It was a small picknic area in the shadow of the cliffside with their stakeout camp at the top.

"How you've been assigning nighttimes?" Rosa asked tried to sound proffesional.

"We haven't been? The park's closed at night time."

"Alright anything else we need to know?" Rosa speed through the interaction as she could feel small leaks escaping her.

###

Amy steeled herself before she got out of the truck. Rosa had shoot out as soon as they came close to a stop and Ranger Christianson had defiently noticed. She didn't want to him to think she was desperate to pee, she had to be discreet even if Rosa wasn't.

She cursed that decision as the ranger spoke up from the back of the truck.

"Would you help unload your bags? I think your partner is doing the debrief of the guys."

Amy looked up and saw a very crosslegged Rosa, talking to one of the guys from the previus team, next to the edge of the forrest.

"Sure" Amy figured the quicker they unloaded, the quicker the men would leave and they could pee in private.

Unloading the bags and carrying them over to the tents wasn't easy with a full bladder. Unlike Rosa she had no way of crossing her legs or generally helping her body hold in the flood but after much work and quite a bit of leaking, their bags was laying at the campfire and the deputies was loaded and ready to leave. Amy walked over to Rosa and the deputy she was talking to.

"You're all set" She said and crossed her legs copying Rosa's stand.

"Perfect I think we're done as well" Deputy Clayton said and shook the detectives hands before joining the others in the truck.

"I HAVE to pee SO fucking bad" Amy wimpered as soon as the last door was closed.

"Same" Rosa nodded as they waved to the truck. Soon the truck disappeared behind the surrounding trees.

"Oh my god" Amy jammed her hands in her crotch and potty-danced on the spot.

Rosa quickly removed her pants and panties and squatted moments before her drips turned to flood and a loud hiss sorrunded the detectives.

"Not Fair" Amy cried as Rosa sighed contend.

"Oh no! no no no no no no" Amy could no longer hold back the flood and she looked down as her jeans started to darken.

Her muscles had nothing more to give and she was powerless to resist her bladder anymore. As warmth spread down her legs and her swollen bladder finally began shrinking to normal size she couldn't help but enjoy the feeling of relief.

Until Rosa's voice pulled her back down to earth.

"Damn".
