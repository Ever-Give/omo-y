Meet Ikumi Takada, a seemingly ordinary first year high school student at Shin-kamafuchi Private High School.

Ikumi is pretty much an average girl...well, if you don't take into account that Ikumi is ravishingly beautiful, with radiant flowing and shining jet black hair that she ties back in a ponytail with an almost metallic crimson red ribbon complete with the cutest little bow tie, the way her eyes glow like mahogany colored jewels that sparkle like a diamond in the light of the moon, the way her shoulders are so sleek and slender and gently slope like a perfect rolling hill, the way the smell of her light perfume permiates all around you, entrancing you in a euphoric intoxication that you don't even want to snap out of, or the way her body is like that of a goddess, so petit and frail, and yet, so curvy and fluid...

The curvature of her back, the alluring rises and falls of her round, refined and newly developing chest, the elegance of her timid and fragile little hands and soft, slender arms that you want to just hook your arms around and never let go of, the texture of her butt was such that you could just see the perfect roundness and smoothness, yet child-like firmness of it accentuated, even as it was well hidden underneath that navy blue Blazer skirt that she and all the other girls wore as their mandatory school uniform, complete with a navy blue jumper top with a red-orange ascot.

Her legs also...legs that any girl would kill to have...so pale and weak and soft-looking and long and slender, yet so firm and proportionate to the rest of her fairy tale-like beauty.

Aside from her looks, Ikumi is generally an ordinary Japanese girl, she gets good marks in most all her subjects, she lives in a small apartment with her best friend Maki Ueda, her favorite hobbies are shopping, karaoke and learning how to cook, she is very refined and quiet and elegant, she doesn't say much in school unless she is talking with her friends between classes, she is extremely polite...her keigo is emaculate, she walks as if her feet never even touch the ground....so smoothly you can't even hear her footsteps on the marble floor.

This is the same girl...who for the first time in her life...will have an accident that brings her to discover something that will change her dull life (and possibly her reputation) forever...and it will all happen from one little mistake she makes one morning when she wakes up late and is unable to conduct her usual routine of getting up, fixing her hair, using the toilet, brushing her teeth and preparing herself for the day ahead.

Ikumi hears a voice in her sleep, hollering her name...beckoning her to...WAKE UP!!

Suddenly, her eyes open and becomes aware of the sounds beckoning her...her older brother is annoyed at her, calling for her to get out of bed and get ready for school, she wipes the sleep from her weary eyes and gazes at her alarm to see that it's...ALREADY 8:15!!!?

(Ikumi) "oh no, my alarm must not have gone off...shoot, I'm going to miss the bus, ohhhhhhh, I don't have time to do anything but get dressed"

She quickly put on her clean blazer uniform and began frantically searching for her shoes and her wabaki (school shoes), once she found them, she put on her cotton white socks and began rushing downstairs, she unconsciously remembered that she forgot to use the toilet, and this consequently caused her to have a sudden slight urge to want to go pee, but she put it out of her mind, as she was out of time, she had only 10 minutes left to make it to school on time, her brother rolled his eyes as she came stumbling out of the apartment, in a bumb-rush to get into his car.

(Ikumi) huff huff huff...huff huff...How did...huff you...know I was running late?

(Brother)I didn't...I was just coming by to drop something off you had forgotten, and I find you still in bed...what's up? You don't normally do stupid stuff like that.

(Ikumi) I'm sorry, I must have studied too late and fell asleep late, I'm so sorry for troubling you Nii-sama

(Brother) eee---...don't sweat it squirt, just make me something for lunch tomorrow and we'll call it even, mkay?

(Ikumi) okay, sure, what would you like Nii-sama?

(brother) hmm, well, anything is fine, surprize me or something.

Ikumi had a glowing, chipper smile on her face as she was happy that her brother had bailed her out of trouble and gave her a ride to school, she was so grateful in her heart, that she wished that she could make his lunch everyday from then on, but she decided to simply obey her brother's request and just do it for that next day.

Her smile was quickly drowned away by a feeling of discomfort, when her brother hit a bump in the road, she began to feel an urge to pee again, and it made her a little uncomfortable, as she began to contemplate on how she was going to find time to use the girls room at school...she never had time during the day, being that there were only 5 minutes to get to the next class after each period, and her friends always wanted to talk for a minute along the way, therefore she had always been forced to hold it in until she got home...which, by then, she was usually nearly bursting to go, and it seemed like she just barely made each and everyday...

And every night, while she studied vigourously, she would always drink quite a bit of tea to cool herself off on the account that it was very hot this time of year..sweltering in fact, so, she always woke up needing to go to the bathroom, but she had always woken up on time in the morning and had time to relieve herself and follow her daily routines of getting ready for school, but today was different somehow, she became too wrapped up in her notes and homework to realize how late it was getting, and she dozed off at some unthinkable hour and was in such a deep slumber that she missed her alarm going off.

She knew that she was going to pay dearly for this mistake...because if today was like any other day, then she would have to face the fact that she was going to have to hold it in all day once again...but the thought had crossed her mind that if she barely made it home when she was normally empty in the morning...then was it even possible to hold on that long if she was already feeling the sensation of being half full? it made her cringe with worry and anticipation of the very real fact that there was a strong probability that she would not be able to make until she got home, especially since she didn't really ever change habits or routines..

And she had a habit of drinking lots of cold Jasmine tea that she liked so much that the school served..it was her substitution for the lack of food she ate during the day, and that would likely tripple or even quadruple the internal pressure that she was already feeling now, she quivered at the thought of it, but she knew it was inevitable...she was going to either have to find another way to get to a toilet, or else she was going to have to prepare for some serious problems in the next several hours.
