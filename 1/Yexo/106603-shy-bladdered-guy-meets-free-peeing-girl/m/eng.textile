Shy-bladdered guy meets free peeing girl

This is the first chapter of a hopefully quite long story. It's told first person from a male character but will include both male and female desperation/wetting/other stuff I haven't decided.

”Wanna go hang around for a bit?”

Everyone in our small group had been down. Not much else to do early afternoon on Friday in our town. As usual we ended up in the mall food court. Best place for a group of misfit young people.

Chris, the epitomic skaterboy sitting across from me, noticed Emma paying enough attention to her soda and obligingly dumped a couple of his fries into the sprite.

“Fuck you, you literal child.” Sputtered the beanie clad, black-dyed-haired girl getting a mouthful of wet fries. Much to the amusement of the rest of our table.

“Fuck off, I’m as legal as the rest of you” Chris said between mouthfuls of burger.

“When is your birthday again?” said Will replacing the hour-old toothpick with a new one from the packet that he kept in the inside pocket of his leather jacket.

“9 months before yours, ask your mom” Chris rested his elbow on the table and extended a middle finger in Wills direction.

“Will you fuckers behave, while I go to the bathroom?” Petra rolled her eyes at the spectacle and rose from our booth.

When no one else immediately said anything, I saw an opportunity.

“I’ll come with you.”

You see I have a crippling shy bladder. Like naked on-stage shy. And therefore, being in a group setting always requires a strategy, cause if I just willy-nilly announce my intentions to go, I’m running the risk that Chris or Will is gonna tag along.

So, when no-one else tagged along with Petra I jumped at the opportunity even if I didn’t really need to pee.

“Oh shit, I’m glad you tagged along” Petra turned to me on the walk toward the mall toilets.

Petra stood out among our group of people who stood out. Everyone who looked over at us would wonder what she was doing with the “out-group”. She was easily the prettiest girl of our year and had a fashion sense straight out of – somewhere fashionable. That’s not really my scene.

“Always nice to fell wanted.” I teased knowing full well that wasn’t what she meant.

While Petra looked like a homecoming princess, she rarely had any time to hang around with the mean girls or jocks where you’d expect to find her.

“You know what I mean” She tilted her head and looked at me pleading.

Instead, she spent most of her time following as many newspapers and financial reports as possible. You see Petra had a “hobby” day trading. The rest of us agreed that it seemed more like an addiction.

“Trouble staying liquid at the moment?” I teased as Petra’s continual lack of actual cash was a common topic of ridicule in our friend group.

“Yes, but I can send you a couple of stocks in Jaddel! It’s a real exciting tech-start up!”

“I’m good, just take it” I handed over a 5-cent coin needed for the turnstiles that blocked the mall bathrooms. Allegedly it was in order to spend more on cleaning staff and improve customer experiences. Not sure either of those things actually happened.

After we’d both gone through the turnstile and I had gotten more info on Jaddel than I ever wanted, we headed into the separate bathrooms, with me hoping the men’s would be empty.

No such luck. 2 of the urinals were free but the stall was occupied and there was a guy at the last urinal. Luckily, he just finished and walked over to the sinks when I entered. Not wanting to be that weird guy who walks in and then out of the bathroom I went over to the urinals and unzipped, feeling like the guy washing his hands were staring at me until he left the bathroom.

For a moment after he left, I felt my bladder slowly starting to open and a bit of urine running through my penis, but then the toilet in the stall was flushed and it everything was sucked back into my bladder.

“Fuck” I whispered to myself and hurriedly shook a couple of droplets into the urinal. I hurried through washing my hands almost finishing before the stall was opened.

When we returned to the table after, even more info on Jaddel, the others were packing up their stuff.

“Get your shit, the security guard has started circling the food court a bit too often” Joce greeted us by nodding towards a grumpy looking dude dressed up like a soldier in a warzone. It didn’t take many times getting thrown out of the local mall to pick up the signs that we’d overstayed our welcome.

Joce, or Jocelyn as she was actually named, was the final member of our group. A short-haired quiet bookworm who could discus just about every topic from every angle yet knew exactly what she believed. For people looking in on our group from the outside Joce was probably the easiest to forget, but we on the inside knew that for Joce fighting injustices wasn’t just talking policy.

###

An hour or so later we were splitting a mix of whatever we succeeded getting from the 7-11, sitting on a picnic table in the corner of the local park. I was starting to feel my bladder sitting heavier and heavier, unfortunately I hadn’t had a good opening again as only Chris had gone.

I shifted my weight a bit and crossed my legs under the table when Joce put her book down on the table and rose.

“I’ll be back in a bit, gotta pee”

Waiting a second without any other biters I tried to nonchalantly get up from the table.

“Yeah, might as well”

We walked over to the park’s public bathrooms without much small talk and were greeted with quite a line to the women side of the small building that housed the bathrooms.

“Urgh great” Joce sighed and tried to gauge how many people were in line.

“Guess I’ll see you back at the table.” I joked.

Joce swayed in place a bit and looked at me.

“Any chance you wanna tell me if the men’s are clear?”

I fucking hope so I though as my belt was starting to dig into my bladder. I really could use a chance to pee this time.

“Sure, I’ll let you know” I said and walked over to the men’s bathroom with Joce waiting outside.

The smell of stale restroom hit me hard when I walked inside and unfortunately there was a guy peeing quite loud at the urinals, so I quickly scanned the 2 stalls, both of which were unlocked.

I walked into the first stall and were greeted with quite a gross toilet. After undoing my belt to relieve some pressure I used my shoe to flip the seat up. As I got my penis out from my underwear, I heard the sink running. I felt my bladder begging for release, but it wouldn’t budge before the sink stopped and a couple of drops started dripping from the tip in anticipation of being alone.

Unfortunately, the sound of the door opening was accompanied by a “Oh you first”

“Thanks” of people arriving at the same door at the same time from different sides. My bladder muscles slammed shut as footsteps made their way over to the urinals.

A bit of pleading under my breath did little to help the flow start back up and I conceded defeat. After pulling my pants back up and redoing my belt I felt a couple drops leak into my underwear as an assertive fuck you from the part of my bladder that desperately wanted relief.

Back outside Joce was looking hopefully at me with crossed legs, swaying a bit from side to side.

“Just one guy.” I said as the door opened, and he left.

“So, it’s free?” Joce said trying and failing to hide excitement.

I looked longingly at the bathroom door. Yes, it’s free and you can go in, and be alone and pee. My bladder was screaming “Empty me” from my abdomen. I was about to step toward the door when I looked back at Joce and nodded.

“The first stall is gross” I said to her back as she walked, a bit too fast to be casually, towards the door.

As she disappeared into the bathroom I hung around outside. Joce didn’t exactly have a habit of using both bathrooms, but it certainly wasn’t the first time. Once it had resulted in some heated words and a black eye for Joce. And while we were all pretty sure the other guy looked worse; we all had an unspoken agreement to be around - just in case.

Don’t tell Joce, we’d get our asses kicked if word got out.

This however also meant that I could quite clearly hear a low hiss coming from behind the bathroom door, which concerned me as it wasn’t exactly calming knowledge for a shy bladder.

After a couple of minutes Joce reemerged.

“You want to keep hanging around the toilet some more or…?” She looked at me puzzled.

I cast a last look at the bathroom door and turned around to walk back with Joce.

When we arrived back, Will had decided to call it a day and left the group. 10 minutes later Petra went to the toilet alone despite my desperate need to follow her. This however left me alone with Joce, who was completely focused reading, on my side of the table and I dared slip my hand under the table to squeeze the tip of my penis on the outside of my jeans. Despite my bladders shyness it was rapidly threating a VERY public relief. I felt as though my body was pee all the way up to my chest.

When Petra returned it she stayed a very short time before bidding farewell as well, which caused a bit of a breakup-snowball. While Petra packed her stuff Joce finished her book and started packing as well. After Joce it wasn’t more than 10-15 minutes before Chris got a call that, judging by his reaction, reminded him that his shift at the burger king had started some time ago and before we knew it, he was gone as well.

I was about to start packing up and head home, with a stop at the bathroom praying it would be empty, when Emma looked at me.

“I don’t feel like going home yet. Hang a bit more? Please?”

I frantically tried to think of any excuse to leave but none came to mind. Any excuse would probably just end up with Emma wanting to walk to her bus stop together. No chance for a bathroom visit that way either, so I plopped down on the bench and quickly crossed my legs as it forced a couple more drops to end up in my underwear.

“Yay! So how is everything? I feel like we never chat just the two of us” Emma leant her crossed arms on the table.

“Oh, they’re good” I nodded as my inner monolog continued, I’m about to piss myself, I got pee up to my eyes.

“You?” I enquired as a wave required all my strength to hold back.

“Oh come on dude. That’s a shitty answer!” She challenged me.

“Sorry just not a lot to tell” I pleaded trying to satisfy her.

“Well my things are shit. Mom and dad are fighting a lot.” She leant back with her arms crossed.

“Just kinda want to get out of there” She looked off into the distance.

I had to lean a forward and really grab my penis as another wave forced more pee into my underwear. A strained sigh escaped my lips and I felt a hand on my shoulder.

“Dude what the fuck? Are you okay?”

“Fuck… no” I stammered as tears formed in the corners of my eyes. Or the urine was trying to find a new escape route.

“I really really gotta piss”

“Damn how much did you drink? Didn’t you just go?” Emma furrowed her eyes and looked towards the public bathrooms.

“Couldn’t” I stammer between pained breaths.

“Huh?”

“Shy bladder” I explained as it dawned on me, I was going to pee my pants in broad daylight in the park.

“Come” Emma said and grabbed both our bags and took me by the hand dragging me through the park.

I elected to let her guide me and instead focusing on holding the massive wave inside. My free hand was holding my penis as closed as possible, but a small stream still escaped every now and then.

I have no clue how long she dragged me before I heard our bags landing on the grass and saw Emma undoing her black jeans in front of me.

“What are you waiting for?” she nodded at my jeans, and I quickly started undoing my belt and pulling my dick from my damp underwear.

As soon as it felt the free air the pee that was making its way out to my underwear fled back into my bladder.

“Come on, come on, come on” I whispered as I heard Emma peeing beside me.

I still don’t know if it was the sound of Emma’s stream, her hand grabbing mine, my bladder just finally giving up or some combination of all three, but a couple of moments later I felt urine running through my penis and creating a very forceful stream of my own. I couldn’t help but moan as the pressure in my abdomen fell and I completely disassociated until my stream was down to being a small stream quickly turning to lose drops.

Finally peeing had been such a crazy experience that I had completely forgotten where I was, and the fact Emma was right besides me. She had clearly finish before me as she was fully dressed when she leant over to me and whispered, “Well done”.

Now I had always found Emma the most attractive of the people in our group as I loved the Emo/Alt aesthetic, but I had never thought of her as anything other than a friend. But goddamn. The relief was one thing, but her words sent a chill down my spine and made me feel something I hadn’t felt before.

Once again, I was thrown from my senses and my mind were spinning so much I that didn’t register her grabbing her bag and saying “See you on Monday” until she had already disappeared out of sight from the grouping of bushes and trees, she had dragged me to.

Thank you! ❤️ Tho if you count almost 13.000 characters as a teaser you might be disappointed by the length of the next chapters lol

*005*2024-11-23 16:02

The rest of the day went by in a blur. The only firm thing in my mind from the evening and the morning after was Emma’s profile in my phone as I tried to cobble a sentence together in the small text window. It had become early afternoon before I dared hit send.

(Hey – thanks for the help yesterday 😅)

God, it sounded dumb no matter how I worded it. I felt my cheeks turning red as the events of the previous day played in my head. Even more so when the small check mark appeared under my message, notifying me that Emma had seen it. Even more so when the 3 dots signaling reply wasn’t jumping around.

I spend the next couple of hours sure that a couple of embarrassing moments was the end of my social life. No question that Emma had spread the text and told everyone about what had happened. The rest of our friend group was probably already laughing about it gathered at the table at the mall food court. I felt so humiliated that I almost didn’t look at my phone when it buzzed. Undoubtedly it was someone making fun of me.

(Sorry about the late answer just got off work)

(But of course, no worries <3!)

Well, I still felt embarrassed but in a different way. I had expected Emma to react in a way completely unlike her. I had branded her a poor friend completely unearned.

(You’re a gem! Busy day?)

(putting it gently. No breaks)

(I’m starving!)

(Don’t you work in a restaurant?)

(Yeah, but it’s been chaos. No way I’m going back in! )

(But you gotta eat something)

(Ill live)

(It’s worse that I gotta pee bad lol)

(And am thirsty, how does that work?)

I instinctively hid my phone from the room around me. Despite being alone it felt like contraband somehow. It was far from the first time I’d heard Emma or someone else mention need to pee, but this time it peaked my curiosity. I wondered how bad it was, how long it had been bad, did she need to hide it while working. Again, I felt my cheeks heat up.

(Omg, that sucks! Long way home?)

(30 mins)

(ish)

(Looong!)

I involuntarily held my breath a bit. Emma sounded quite desperate, at least in my head. Who knows how she was actually feeling.

(Guess you should stop by the park lol)

This time the checkmark appeared alone. It stood out as if in the spotlight of a stage without the backup dancers of the Emma is typing bubbles.

I’d fucked it. This time there was no coming back. Why did I have to try to be fun? It must have come across very weird. Again and again I started typing some kind of apology or explanation, but the rational part of my brain was telling me that I could only dig myself deeper. I was better off letting it be and owning a very awful joke on Monday morning. No matter how much it taunted me.

(Really should have lol)

(Sorry, can’t text on the bus)

(I get car sick)

Salvation. Redemption. She’d still responded and even kinda positively. I was so glad that I hadn’t overstepped that I almost forgot to answer her. Almost.

(It’s that bad?)

(huh never knew that)

(dude worsse)

(guess we both have quicks lol)

(how far to go?)

(true true😂)

(idk)

(5 6 mins)

(and then front door)

(You can do it!)

(about to pee tho)

(You’re so close!)

While I was cheering on Emma and hoping that she’d make it, knowing all too well the embarrassment of not doing so, there still was a part of me that was, curious is probably the right-est word, about what would happen if she didn’t. Would she tell me? She couldn’t just ignore it now, right? What would she say? What if she found somewhere to squat?

Those questions would have to be answered another time as my phone dinged again but this time I was greeted by a picture of Emma’s forehead and a hand above it, closed except for two fingers doing the peace sign. While I had never been to Emma’s house something about the wall behind her somehow screamed bathroom wall.

(fucking made it!)

Was she sitting on the toilet while taking that picture? My mind raced at the thought. It somehow seemed very intimate to see her while she was peeing. Even if it was only her forehead.

(Hahaha impressive)

(barely lol)

(Thanks – it actually helped talking about it)

(glad to be of service lol)

(Gonna jump in a shower, text you after?)

Feeling emboldened by Emma’s seemingly laissez faire attitude to the whole thing, I decide to gamble.

(It was that close huh?)

(Fuck off!)

(Its work sweat)

I was about halfway through typing an apology when Emma relented.

(Mostly lol)

I tried playing a bit with the formatting so if it looks wonky on phones I'm sorry 😅

This was the last of my interaction with Emma that weekend. I had no idea how I could respond to her last text. The idea that girls sometimes leaked when very desperate wasn’t entirely foreign to me but somehow the image of Emma leaking slightly when trying to unlock her front door was stuck in my mind all through Saturday evening and Sunday. I’m sure I attempted to figure out how to make some witty remark that could pry more information from her but after a while it just became too weird to answer.

Instead, I packed everything that had happened the last couple of days into a box in the back of my mind and prepared myself for a completely normal week.

Monday morning brings a class I share with Emma and Joce. Luckily when I arrived Joce was already sitting in the classroom with empty seats either side. It wasn’t that I didn’t want to see Emma again, in fact I really did, but I still feared how awkward it might be between us the first time we saw each other face-to-face. Now I could place myself next to Joce and let Emma choose who of the two of us she’d be next to. Meanwhile I let Joce tell me about her weekend that had been spend fundraising for an unnamed ecological group.

As fate would the chair on the other side of Joce was occupied before Emma arrived, barely before the lesson begun, and she dutifully sat down next to me with a quick greeting to me and Joce both.

Because of Emma’s late arrival we had no chance to talk before the class broke for a small break, and the three of us were standing in the hallway small talking amongst ourselves. That is to say Joce and Emma was discussing the ethical implications of a point being raised by our lecturer, while I strategically nodded and hummed along. Even out short break however, proved too long to keep a discussion going when both parties vehemently agreed and soon the point was moot.

“Well might as well…?” Joce concluded and nodded towards the toilets.

Despite our normal tendency to be around when out and about, campus was the clear exception. Not only was Joce well-known and if not liked by everyone at least respected enough that no one would raise a fuss, most of the bathrooms were unisex. Massive win for gender equality, massive annoyance for those of us who now had to dodge everyone to have a chance to be alone and relieve themselves. On further though I might be the only one in that particular club.

“Did I scare you off?” Emma pulled me from my thoughts with something that sounded halfway between a mumble and a whisper.

“Huh?”

“You never replied…” Emma sighed keeping her gaze decidedly not anywhere near at me. Something I was silently grateful for as I felt my cheeks heat up.

“I… uh. I didn’t… When I thought of something to say I… it felt like, it had been a while… so” I stammered out as I scratched my shoulder for want of anything better to do with my hands.

Emma finally turned her gaze to me.

“It would be weird?” she scoffed as she finished my thought.

“Yeah?”

“Dude. I think we’re past weird. After Friday?” Emma spoke bluntly but somehow softened it to a compliment with her short soft giggle.

How could I argue with that. Our relationship was forever changed after the park mishap. Not only had I barely managed to not piss myself in front of her, she also was the only one who knew one of my most securely held secrets.

“…fair” I squeaked out and quickly tried to rub the heat out of my cheek as Joce was quickly rejoining us.

“Should we head back in?” She nodded towards the classroom without slowing down.

The rest of the lesson and lunch was mostly uninteresting. We all (except for Petra, who had chosen her classes such that she’d not have any lessons scheduled on Mondays, and therefore wasn’t on campus) met up for lunch, getting regaled by Chris about how unfair and cruel his manager was for not letting him go home when his shift had ended, enjoying immensely Chris’s vexed scorn when Emma suggested he “grew the fuck up and started going to work on time” and feigning sympathy when Will sulked that his band still couldn’t find the right bassist.

As we finished up and split up into groups going to different parts of the campus, I walked through the hallways with Emma and Will, feeling the dull pressure of my bladder filling. As we reached the classroom, I couldn’t help but look to the bathrooms a bit down the hall.

“I’ll be a minute…” I poked Emma’s shoulder as she was about to follow Will inside.

She looked at me confused for a secund before nodding and waving slightly as I walked towards the bathrooms. Could I wait? Sure. It wasn’t entirely rare that I went the entire day before rushing home barely holding on. But some part of me theoriesed… maybe even hoped, that Emma would ask me to follow her to her bus. And it seemed like the end of the lunch break and a bathroom away from the canteen gave the best chances for being alone.

As luck would have it, I was right. No one was around and I quickly emptied my bladder entirely drama free. I had reached so far as to washing my hands before the door was flung open by a blond missile that shot past me into a stall.

“Fuck fuck Fuck!” I gathered from the mumbled yelps coming through the door along the rustling of clothes being pulled and yanked.

As I turned off the faucet and kept my eyes on my own image, I could see the mirrored cheeks redden as a hiss and a content sigh was accompanied by a thud of someone not so much sitting as landing on the toilet.

I wanted to leave. I should leave. But somehow, I could get myself to actually start walking away instead I let my mind wander to what could have possibly preceded the scenes happening in the stall. Feeling emboldened by Emma and primarily the fact that she probably hadn’t gotten a better look at me than I had of her. Realistically she’d probably not even noticed me.

“You okay?” I wondered if she could hear me over the sound her stream was making, but she clearly could as I almost felt her tense up.

“….yeah” came the soft voice from the other side over the weakened stream of someone trying desperately to cut of something that wouldn’t stop.

“Sorry… just wanted to… I’ll…”

I quickly got my legs working again and hurried out the bathroom and back to the classroom, mind wandering the entire time. God she was bursting. Had she come from a class? No way she would sit through lunch like that. Was that what Emma looked…

I shook the last though from my head as I snuck into class, trying to interrupt as little as possible. Luckily Emma had kept the seat next to her empty and I quickly sat down and attempted to focus on the lesson. This attempt was almost immediately kneecapped as Emma slid her notebook closer towards me and jutted a note on the edge of the lined page.

Succes?

I looked at her puzzled and despite only being able to see half her face as she kept her gaze on the whiteboard, I couldn’t help but notice her eye roll. Presumably synchronized with the one hidden from me.

Was it empty

She clarified in a new note without looking away from our lecturer.

Yeah 🙂

I scribbled as quickly as possible trying to keep my handwriting somewhat readable for someone else. For the first time ever, I cursed myself for not practicing it more. Emma glanced down and quickly scribbled again letting me see the

Before pulling the notebook back to herself.

When the lesson finished up most of the students, Will included as he vaguely explained something about a band meeting, quickly gathered their things and headed off into the afternoon. Emma, however, was in no rush. She wasn’t slow by any means, but it was clear that she intended to be one of the last people out of the room. Somehow this felt like an invitation, and “ball is in your court” sorta moment.

By sheer habit I had zipped up my bag rather quickly but still I hung around waiting for Emma to zip her bag.

“Wanna keep me company till my bus arrives?” Emma asked sounding entirely spontaneous.

“Lead the way” I nodded and got out of her way.

“So… what did you think of?” Emma turned to me as we walked down the hallway.

I looked at her puzzled. She rolled her eyes at me once again.

“You said when you finally thought of something it had been so long that I would be weird…”

I blushed. What prompted her to remember that? I guess we had been standing in a similar hallway earlier, but it still came a bit out of nowhere. Or she’d been wondering about it since then?

“I… uh, I was about to ask how long it had been… if you were so… it got so close”.

Emma seemed to consider my question for two moments before smirking slightly.

“Oh, you could have asked that no worries…” She concluded very deliberately not answering the question.

I guess she didn’t say she would have answered me, but her tone seemed to invite me to enquire further. But why didn’t she then just tell me? It was like she challenged me to actually say the words. After a couple of silent moments, I had finally built up the nerves and fought the blush to a minimum.

“So… how long had it been since last?”

Emma’s smirk turned to a slight giggle before she looked to the celling feigning having to dig through her memories.

“I don’t know. Probably before I got to work… so like 8 hours maybe?”

I lost the fight to keep the blushing to a minimum and took an immense interest in the lawn we were crossing on the way to the bus stops.

She stopped me by swings her body around standing in front of me.

“Listen” Her face interrupting my study of the grass.

“It’s kinda endearing how awkward you are about this, and I hoped it would help you with…you know. But if it’s so uncomfortable for you please say so.”

It was awkward, and maybe a bit uncomfortable, but it did help… had helped… I thought back to the girl in the bathroom. A week ago, I’d slinked out of there without a word but today I’d spoken up. Probably made her uncomfortable and embarrassed, but I was perhaps getting more, comfortable, better, I don’t know… but I did know that for whatever reason I didn’t want Emma to stop. I wanted her to continue trying to coax me from my awkwardness, from my pee-shyness… I wanted her to text me again the next time she was bursting on her way home… why did I want that?

“No… yes… I mean… It’s helping and I… I’ll promise to say something if… but just bear with my awkwardness for now…” I fidgeted trying to string an actual sentence together.

“It’s helping? How?” Emma crossed her arms unconvinced by my very unconvincing stammering.

I sighed and dropped my shoulders before gathering a deep breath.

“When I was washing my hands, some girl rushed in and barely made it into a stall before… and I, well still felt awkward but I… asked her if she was, okay?”

Now written out there appears to be space between the words, but trust me there was no space when I spoke them. They all stumbled out like a group of new recruits being called out for a surprise inspection by their angry drill sergeant, all trying to fit through the door at the same time running around each other only to be individually noticed when everyone was standing at attention.

Emma, taking the role of the inspecting drill sergeant, took a long moment to inspect every one of my rushed recruits before bursting into laughter, which, as it would have done to the fictional recruits had it been their drill sergeant’s laughter, filled me with equal amounts of surprise and dread.

“Oh the poor fucker” Emma wheezed between giggles and turned to continue walking to her bus stop.

“I was trying to be nice!” Something inside me felt scorned at Emma reaction. I knew that the girl would presumably have preferred me to slink away, keeping the illusion that no-one noticed her plight alive, but still I had genuinely been willing to help her out if she wasn’t okay. I think. I don’t think any part of me had actually thought about what would happen had she said no.

“And you were nice, but god… she must have been mortified…” Emma finally got her giggles down to a minimum and my scorn subsided. She was right. Of course she was. So right I eventually started giggling slightly along.

“So really 8 hours without problems?” I asked trying to change the subject to something that would embarrass me slightly less.

“Well without problems may be overselling it… but yeah more or less.” Emma nodded.

“Not sure I believe you” I teased as her bus pulled up.

“You’ve been around me all day… when did I go pee?” Emma whispered and cocked her head to the side before stepping onto the bus before her words really settled in my mind.

As she took a seat by a window, she waved at me and my unclosed mouth. My mind was racing. God, she hadn’t gone all day… not that I’d noticed at least. And it’s not like she hadn’t been drinking. Her dumb purple water bottle had been a constant companion throughout the classes. She’d even filled it at lunch.

I took out my phone, every question fighting to be the first one out, but I knew she wasn’t going to answer. Not before she got off. How long was that?

(So, is it as bad as the other day?)

I cringed as soon as I had sent it, but I forced a deep breath and told myself to trust in Emma. She’d seemed to invite these kinds of questions. She wanted to help after all. I slid my phone into my pocket again, thought about it, took it out and for the first time in its life I turned notifications sounds on.
